7/31/25,Trail is easy to follow and in great shape. It’s an easy hike. The people saying it’s strenuous are probably beginners and/or out of shape. I really enjoyed this mountain. The views are incredible!! I started 4:50am. Took me 2hr 40min to get to the summit and 2 hours to get back down.

7/23/25,"This is a difficult but worthwhile hike. Hiked the summit with my wife, 12 yr old, 14 yr old and 16 yr old. We are not hikers. We arrived at the visitors center at 9, hit the restrooms, grabbed some prickly pear snacks and got to hiking. Parking was plentiful, and we only saw 5 other couples on the entire trip. Insane. The start of the hike is strenuous with switchbacks and lots of stairs. Then it’s a pretty enjoyable hike until the last half mile to the summit. We were fortunate withy the weather, with temps in the high 60’s when we started and mid 70’s when we finished. Left out at 9:15 to start hiking. Returned to the car at 4:45. We stopped for lunch near the summit on the way back. Gorgeous views from nearly the time you start climbing. We’ve hiked throughout Colorado and were blown away by the beauty and challenge Guadalupe Peak had to offer. Bring more water than you anticipate, it’s extremely windy at the summit, and make sure you have good footwear. Lots of rocky, gravel, granite, and in general rough terrain. 5 out of 5 stars.

It was an unforgettable adventure, but also incredibly challenging, even for our family, who is used to hiking regularly. Our kids, ages 8 and 10, are experienced hikers and accustomed to high-altitude conditions since we live in an elevated area. Despite their preparation and stamina, this trail proved to be tough after so many hours—our pace was 1.1 miles per hour. The trail is rocky, steep, and involves climbing an entire mountain, making it more suitable for adults or older teens. The views along the way are absolutely breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment at the summit is unmatched. However, the high winds made the descent tricky, and the long duration pushed our kids’ endurance to its limits. Even though we were well-prepared with water, snacks, and gear, the sheer length of the hike—combined with the rugged terrain—made it physically exhausting, especially for younger hikers. While we love hiking as a family and would tackle this kind of challenge again in the future, we’d recommend this trail only for those prepared for a long, demanding climb.

1/2/25,"It’s a very beautiful trail! The scenery changes from the beginning, middle and top making it exciting and easy to break down in small chunks. For example, you can hike the steep first 3 miles until the saddle, a really nice rock formation that indicates the start of the “forest” trail. The forest is just awesome! So many trees and beautiful view. From the forest you can hike to the bridge. Nice bridge, take photos there! After the bridge path is narrower and hugs the mountain side, the view is incredibly beautiful! It is already very high from there. After the bridge you are very close to the top, maybe 30-40min depending on your pace. There is only one section of the ridge that needs more attention to the footing, but it is so short, two steps and you are out of it. It is located in the very end, a weird curve to the trail. The top is windy and cold and magnificent! Please do go to the highest point in Texas! I really enjoyed the hike! Pro tips: - allow yourself 8h to do the trail even tho you might finish early. So calculate the finishing time to be before sunset. Staring at 9-10am is a good start time. We started at 10am and finished at 2:30pm. We had time to enjoy the top and take some photos in the way down . - wear good grip shoes. There trail is mostly rocks and sand. You need good shoes. We had Hoka trail runner it was perfect - wear sunglasses. Rocks are so white and shine in your eyes all the time - bring layers if you want to enjoy the top for longer than 2 min. lol - take care of your knees! We had knee braces on! We hiked the Guadalupe trail on Jan 1st, staring at 10am finishing at 2:30pm. 5h round trip. We did not make many stops, only to put/remove layers, all stops were shorter than 5 min.

11/29/24,"Memories of the desert! The Guadalupe Peak Trail in Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of Texas. It is an out and back trail type with 2949 ft elevation gain. The summit provides breathtaking views of the El Capitan and Chihuahuan desert landscape. The trail features steep sections, switchbacks, rough terrain, and narrow paths with drop-offs, especially near the summit where we had to do some scrambling. The trail run through pinyon pine and Douglas-fir forests and is well maintained. We observed various cacti (including prickly pear cactus, cane cholla), sotol, lime pine, and others, in addition to shrubs. We did this trekking on 29th November 2024 to experience the stunning desert environment. It was a bright morning and the weather was excellent. Our first mistake was beginning the trek a little later than planned. This was our first strenuous trekking and it took 9.5 hours to finish which includes multiple pauses, snacking, and photography. Because the time zone was frequently changing, occasionally we found it challenging to keep track of the time. We had to trek in the dark using flashlight for the last 1 hour, for which we were not prepared, but here the fellow hikers are really nice, one couple helped us showing light. The second mistake we did was parked our vehicle near the visitor centre parking area. After this level of hiking, it was very difficult to walk extra few miles in dark to get to our car. A visitor provided us with a lift to the parking lot. We gained a lot of knowledge from this hike. Although we faced a few challenges but still it was a very memorable trek for us. On the basis of our experience following are the suggestions: 1) Begin your trek early in the morning. 2) Before heading out, please check the weather forecast and check the trail conditions from the park’s website. 3) Park your vehicle close to the trail’s parking space. 4) Put on sturdy hiking shoes with good traction. Please make sure you have all your hiking gear (Hiking poles, headlamp, medical kits etc.) with you. 5) Be prepared for shifting weather conditions, and wear layers that you can adjust as needed. 6) Carry snacks and enough water for the entire trek. 7) Don't overextend yourself, and take breaks when necessary. 8) The descent can be more difficult than the ascent, so be ready for loose rocks and possible slips. 9) Leave no trace behind, and pack out all of your trash.","[{""Features"":""Easy to park""},{""Features"":""Great conditions""},{""Features"":""Great views""}]",5,

Eventually, I got above the low clouds and saw some peaks peaking out over the clouds. By the time I reached the summit, most of the clouds had burnt off and I had nice views coming back down. Hike took 4 hours and 25 minutes in total- about 2 hours 25 minutes going up and about 2 hours coming down. If you don’t hike regularly, plan for it to take a bit longer. Sign at trailhead says 6-8 hours, but 8 hours sounds impossibly slow, as that would translate to only one mile per hour, even going downhill.

11/24/24,"Hiked Sunday, 11/24, 8:15 am start Route: Out and back Time to summit: 1:36 Total moving time: 2:57 Mileage: 8.15 Elevation gain: 2860 ft Pain rating: 6 - Severe wind/easy trail Adventure rating: 6 - Texas high point Straightforward climb to an excellent summit. Wind is biggest obstacle on this route. Don’t let prior reviews scare you: this is a National Park trail and is well-defined, well-graded, well-manicured and rates easy/moderate for fit hikers. Nothing sketchy. Beta: Winds at the summit were 55-60 mph today. Expect heavy gusts especially when turning the corner around the 1.5 mile mark (there’s a large bulbous rock outcropping) prior to entering the forest section (the route’s middle third). Heavy gusts along the final set of switchbacks on the summit push as well. Note that despite the wind’s strength, it pushes you against the mountain, not away from it. Snow/ice were mostly negligible; I brought microspikes but they were unnecessary. There was some packed mix at upper elevations that was not all that slippery; on the late morning descent, the mix in the forest section had slushified. GPS/phone signals get bounced around here. My Garmin and phone continually flip-flopped between Mountain and Central time, and my Garmin improperly recorded my elevation gain as being over 4000 feet despite accurate altitudes at the trailhead and summit. There were a few parking spots left when I pulled up at 7:45 am. Flush bathrooms and water at the trailhead as well as the visitors center. Light trail traffic on the ascent, moderate on the descent. Most congested section is the final set of switchbacks.

I took a gallon of water, lots of snacks, electrolytes and had lunch at the top. I started at 7:45am and ended at 3pm- hiking very slowly. I took 45min at the top to just take in the view. There are plenty of shady places to rest along the way. The rangers said the first 2 miles are the most challenging, but the last mile is nothing to laugh at. The last bit the trail is not as clear, so take a map! The views are gorgeous! Apple Watch said it was 9.28 miles and it was 2,834 ft of elevation gain.","[{""Features"":""Easy to park""},{""Features"":""Not crowded""},{""Features"":""Great conditions""},{""Features"":""Great views""}]",5,

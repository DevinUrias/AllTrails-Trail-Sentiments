0,2025-07-31,Trail is easy to follow and in great shape. It’s an easy hike. The people saying it’s strenuous are probably beginners and/or out of shape. I really enjoyed this mountain. The views are incredible!! I started 4:50am. Took me 2hr 40min to get to the summit and 2 hours to get back down. Definitely start well before sunrise to beat the heat.,"Easy to park, Not crowded, Great conditions, Great views",5.0

3,2025-07-23,"This is a difficult but worthwhile hike. Hiked the summit with my wife, 12 yr old, 14 yr old and 16 yr old. We are not hikers. We arrived at the visitors center at 9, hit the restrooms, grabbed some prickly pear snacks and got to hiking. Parking was plentiful, and we only saw 5 other couples on the entire trip. Insane. The start of the hike is strenuous with switchbacks and lots of stairs. Then it’s a pretty enjoyable hike until the last half mile to the summit. We were fortunate withy the weather, with temps in the high 60’s when we started and mid 70’s when we finished. Left out at 9:15 to start hiking. Returned to the car at 4:45. We stopped for lunch near the summit on the way back. Gorgeous views from nearly the time you start climbing. We’ve hiked throughout Colorado and were blown away by the beauty and challenge Guadalupe Peak had to offer. Bring more water than you anticipate, it’s extremely windy at the summit, and make sure you have good footwear. Lots of rocky, gravel, granite, and in general rough terrain. 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommend, and with enough rest, would do it again.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Great conditions, Great views",5.0

5,2025-07-21,Mostly an incline trail with sections where it feels like you’re walking up stairs. Some parts of the trail were slightly washed away. There is a really exposed section near the top where you had to hold the rock wall with your hands to get across. Started at 5am and ended at 12pm. It started getting hot when the sun came out.,"Good views, Easy to park, Not crowded",4.0

8,2025-07-16,"I hiked Guadalupe Peak on July 16. Started at 5:45, and watched the sun come up! Gorgeous views, cool, shady, especially when you turn the corner into the shady forest. The first part of the trail is mainly steps, so your glutes get a workout (and harder going down). Beautiful flowers in bloom all the way up. Summited and returned to trailhead in 6.5 hours, and I am a 62 year old woman in pretty good shape. Take LOTS of water, as the sun gets hot. This is NOT a hike to start at 10 AM in the summer. I think Guadalupe National Park is my favorite national park. Fabulous trails! Rangers are nice and helpful. Do it!",,5.0

11,2025-07-13,"12 July 2025. Popped into the visitor center and was warmly greeted by a ranger with more face tatts than Post Malone, nice enough though and warned us of potential thunderstorms. All weather reports showed no risk until evening. We headed out. Clean bathrooms at the trailhead. First mile is moderately difficult and gave way to two miles of relatively easy switchbacks. Smooth sailing up to the campground. The last mile becomes moderate again to the top. Previous reports of ""rock exposure"" were vastly overstated. Very limited exposed sections that I wouldn't even consider a scramble. Battling a nasty head cold, still managed a moving time under 5hrs up and down. Summit was socked in, sadly no views. Overall, moderate hike for seasoned hikers. Total distance is 8.4 not 8.",,5.0

28,2025-06-22,"I thought the difficulty of this trail was overblown and that's coming from doing this off the couch and full of Mexican food and Raisin Cane's. Maybe I'm just a sports action god (I'm not - I just had a bunch of caffeine and ibuprofen). That being said, with how the beginning section felt on the way down, I can't imagine having started this later than I did. It would have been abysmal in that heat and the wind died down. Started at 6:15 which was an hour later than desired due to my alarms not going off. Still mostly in the shade and a consistent wind. I changed into shorts very early on. Passed a few parties on the way up and down. Didn't spend too much time at the summit and I didn't stop on the way down but that was mostly because I was running away from the dookie demons if you know what I mean. This trail was much better than I expected with consistent views and manageable terrain. The pictures don't quite do it justice, I was pleasantly surprised","Good conditions, Good views, Easy to park, Not crowded",4.0
29,2025-06-20,"I second what everyone else has said, start early, take more water than you think you will need. You will need it. Check out national parks app for this trail it has great info. We finished just under 5 hours and spent 25 minutes at the top. Fairly experienced hikers with good endurance but a 3000 foot elevation climb is no joke. There is very little shade on the trail and none at the top. One thing that is confusing is Guadalupe National Park observes Mountain Time where as most of Texas observes Central Standard time.

34,2025-06-17,"My absolute favorite Texas hike with great views with desert and alpine scenery. The terrain is somewhat technical, and the first 2 miles are where most of the elevation is gained, which is what makes this hike difficult.

36,2025-06-13,"Started our hike around 9:30 CT and we definitely should have started earlier. It was a scorcher coming down in mid-June Texas heat. Trail was well maintained and there were quite a few people on the trails. Views at the top were spectacular, saw some birds and a few lizards, but otherwise no wildlife. My Apple Watch (I know, don’t judge) clocked us at 5.5 hours total and about 9.7 miles overall. Trail is STRENUOUS, even for us two mid-20s fairly in shape people.

40,2025-06-11,Beautiful hike. Loved almost every minute (the down was not my favorite!). I agree with others that said the first 1.5 miles and the last .5 up were the hardest. Get through those and it’s really not bad. We made it up in 2:15 and down in 1:50. Started at 7:45am and the weather was perfect with just enough shade. Loved the views.

41,2025-06-06,"Started at 6:45 am which was a good idea since the temps were in the 70s and on the way down before noon temps were in the 90s. Very exposed hike with amazing views. The heat is real even with the nice windy spots and some areas of shade (pre noon). Some spicy areas but nothing too lengthy and as long as you kept your eye on the trail, no problems! It took us 5 hours and 19 minutes. We were so glad we started early. We felt bad for those going up the trail at 10-12 when the sun was absolutely blazing and in the 90s. Sun shade hoodies, brimmed hats with airflow, zip off pants and sunscreen made for a hike with flexible temps. Brought 2.5 liters of water in a hydration bladder with electrolytes.

Our recommendations are the same as other reviewers: start as early as possible and bring as much water as possible. Also, pace yourself: it’s a lot harder than you think it will be.

The first and last segments are steep, but the rest is gradual incline. It’s not a hard hike, but the relentless sun can be a factor.

71,2025-05-22,"Parked in the lot at about 4:35 am NM time, wore a headlamp up. First couple miles are pretty brutally uphill, but no issues keeping trail or seeing where to go. It's definitely best this time of year to make it out as early as you can to avoid the heat, as there is very limited shade until you get a couple miles in. It's uphill 95% of the way (shocker) which is why it's nice to do in the morning while it's cooler. You will be rewarded with a beautiful sunrise and much more pleasant temperatures. My GPS messed up with AllTrails, but it took me 4:51 of moving time to make it up and down. My Garmin said it was 8.35 miles round trip. I did stop and hang out for a little bit at the top to have a snack. I drank about 48 oz of water on the way up, being in the dark and early morning sun is much easier on the body. I was carrying an additional half gallon of water just in case though. I saw lots of people with hiking poles if that is your style, I went without. You will need sun protection if you go up later than I started, and bring more water than you think. I can't even imagine trying to do this hike in the heat and broad daylight. It was taxing enough on the body just coming down at 9-10 am. There are a couple pretty steep parts towards the top where you will need to boulder. The loose rock others have mentioned isn't unbearable and I didn't feel like I was losing my footing anywhere. There are lots of rock and wood steps so you can maintain a good pace.

There is a bridge you cross once you get to 3.5 miles before the top and after that there is quite a bit of rock scrambling so watch your step. It was very tough going up because you’re just going up hill for 4+ miles. There are plenty of people doing this hike in 4 ish hours. It took me every bit of 9 hours. Sounds like I would say this hike is hard and don’t do it but, instead I’m saying this hike was really hard for me and I’m so glad I stuck it out and made it to the top because the view is so worth it!

Please, check on the wind gust b/c we were blessed with tolerable winds. We saw families with girls between the ages of 6 and 12 who also made it to the top.

I write this review the day after the hike and I’m sore everywhere. Lots of loose rock in sections so although we saw people doing this hike in tennis shoes, this is a trail for hiking boots. Large steps up rocks in sections though there was usually a walk around for a less strenuous up/down. I agree with other comments about the first 1.5 mile being the most difficult, followed by the last 1/3 or so. Be aware that there is a small section with some drop offs if you bring kids.

263,2025-03-08,"The Guadalupe Peak Trail is a challenging but rewarding hike that takes you to the highest point in Texas at 8,751 feet. The first two miles are the most difficult, with steep switchbacks that quickly gain elevation. Several sections of the trail feature narrow paths with steep drop-offs, adding a thrilling element to the journey. Despite the difficulty, the trail offers incredible views of the surrounding desert landscape, and reaching the summit is a truly satisfying accomplishment. On our hike, we encountered a mini blizzard, which added an extra layer of adventure and made the experience even more memorable. At the summit, we were rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views, and my daughter had the unique honor of being the tallest person in Texas—at least for a moment! The metal obelisk marking the peak serves as a great photo opportunity and a symbol of the achievement. Cold temperatures and high winds at the top reminded us how quickly conditions can change at this altitude. We fueled up with some well-earned trail snacks before making our way back down.

If you are committed to making it to the peak, then be sure to bring enough water, plenty of layers, gloves, a beanie, and especially a headlamp or flashlight. We didn't start the hike until after 11 a.m., so we pretty much accepted that we would be hiking out in the dark. On the way down, we passed a group of about 10 hikers, but only three people in the group had flashlights or headlamps. We saw some people in the group struggling to see where they were going and were dependent on their friends with the flashlights, so they were very slow hiking down. At least we saw they were taking care of each other, and we saw that it would take them a very long time to get down. We got out at 9 p.m. and didn't see them anywhere behind us.

Views from the top are spectacular looking west to Dell City over salt basin dunes. The pyramid shaped monument erected by American Airlines in 1958 commemorates the 100 anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail service which passed south of the mountain. With an elevation gain of 3,000 ft and a return decent along the same route this hike can be considered difficult and is often under estimated by those who hike it.

Honestly, the descent feels harder than the ascent at times, given the rocky nature of the trail. Highly recommend hiking poles. No need for microspikes today. Also, some of the rocks are a bit eroded down due to heavy foot traffic, so they can get a little slick. Solid boots help with that.","Bathrooms available, Great views",5.0
319,2025-02-01,"Incredible Experience, but Definitely Challenging We recently completed this hike in 9 hours and 34 minutes, starting at 8:00 AM and finishing after dark. It was an unforgettable adventure, but also incredibly challenging, even for our family, who is used to hiking regularly. Our kids, ages 8 and 10, are experienced hikers and accustomed to high-altitude conditions since we live in an elevated area. Despite their preparation and stamina, this trail proved to be tough after so many hours—our pace was 1.1 miles per hour. The trail is rocky, steep, and involves climbing an entire mountain, making it more suitable for adults or older teens. The views along the way are absolutely breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment at the summit is unmatched. However, the high winds made the descent tricky, and the long duration pushed our kids’ endurance to its limits. Even though we were well-prepared with water, snacks, and gear, the sheer length of the hike—combined with the rugged terrain—made it physically exhausting, especially for younger hikers. While we love hiking as a family and would tackle this kind of challenge again in the future, we’d recommend this trail only for those prepared for a long, demanding climb. Families with younger kids might want to consider a shorter or less strenuous hike. If you do decide to take on this trail, start early, come prepared, and be ready for an intense but rewarding experience!",Good views,4.0

354,2025-01-02,"It’s a very beautiful trail! The scenery changes from the beginning, middle and top making it exciting and easy to break down in small chunks. For example, you can hike the steep first 3 miles until the saddle, a really nice rock formation that indicates the start of the “forest” trail. The forest is just awesome! So many trees and beautiful view. From the forest you can hike to the bridge. Nice bridge, take photos there! After the bridge path is narrower and hugs the mountain side, the view is incredibly beautiful! It is already very high from there. After the bridge you are very close to the top, maybe 30-40min depending on your pace. There is only one section of the ridge that needs more attention to the footing, but it is so short, two steps and you are out of it. It is located in the very end, a weird curve to the trail. The top is windy and cold and magnificent! Please do go to the highest point in Texas! I really enjoyed the hike! Pro tips: - allow yourself 8h to do the trail even tho you might finish early. So calculate the finishing time to be before sunset. Staring at 9-10am is a good start time. We started at 10am and finished at 2:30pm. We had time to enjoy the top and take some photos in the way down . - wear good grip shoes. There trail is mostly rocks and sand. You need good shoes. We had Hoka trail runner it was perfect - wear sunglasses. Rocks are so white and shine in your eyes all the time - bring layers if you want to enjoy the top for longer than 2 min. lol - take care of your knees! We had knee braces on! We hiked the Guadalupe trail on Jan 1st, staring at 10am finishing at 2:30pm. 5h round trip. We did not make many stops, only to put/remove layers, all stops were shorter than 5 min.

My biggest concern heading into the day was whether there would be snow or ice, but fortunately, as of today, there was absolutely none. That being said, I was clouded in for most of my time above 8k ft, but the few times I got views made it worth it. The scale of these mountains compared to everything else nearby is insane. Trail conditions were exactly like all the other popular trails I've done out West - maintained, easy to follow, and filled with an unbelievable amount of switchbacks. While the ascent was rocky and continuous, those switchbacks made it easy to make good time. Even though it wasn't windy today, a windbreaker would probably be a good idea for Guadalupe Peak's reputation. I'd also recommend hiking poles for an easier descent. There is a $10 parking fee, which is paid at the information/welcome center. As expected for a Saturday, there were some crowds, but they were all pretty spread out. In terms of exposure, there were only two somewhat sketchy no-fall zones, but I never felt scared at any point today.

416,2024-11-29,"Memories of the desert! The Guadalupe Peak Trail in Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of Texas. It is an out and back trail type with 2949 ft elevation gain. The summit provides breathtaking views of the El Capitan and Chihuahuan desert landscape. The trail features steep sections, switchbacks, rough terrain, and narrow paths with drop-offs, especially near the summit where we had to do some scrambling. The trail run through pinyon pine and Douglas-fir forests and is well maintained. We observed various cacti (including prickly pear cactus, cane cholla), sotol, lime pine, and others, in addition to shrubs. We did this trekking on 29th November 2024 to experience the stunning desert environment. It was a bright morning and the weather was excellent. Our first mistake was beginning the trek a little later than planned. This was our first strenuous trekking and it took 9.5 hours to finish which includes multiple pauses, snacking, and photography. Because the time zone was frequently changing, occasionally we found it challenging to keep track of the time. We had to trek in the dark using flashlight for the last 1 hour, for which we were not prepared, but here the fellow hikers are really nice, one couple helped us showing light. The second mistake we did was parked our vehicle near the visitor centre parking area. After this level of hiking, it was very difficult to walk extra few miles in dark to get to our car. A visitor provided us with a lift to the parking lot. We gained a lot of knowledge from this hike. Although we faced a few challenges but still it was a very memorable trek for us. On the basis of our experience following are the suggestions: 1) Begin your trek early in the morning. 2) Before heading out, please check the weather forecast and check the trail conditions from the park’s website. 3) Park your vehicle close to the trail’s parking space. 4) Put on sturdy hiking shoes with good traction. Please make sure you have all your hiking gear (Hiking poles, headlamp, medical kits etc.) with you. 5) Be prepared for shifting weather conditions, and wear layers that you can adjust as needed. 6) Carry snacks and enough water for the entire trek. 7) Don't overextend yourself, and take breaks when necessary. 8) The descent can be more difficult than the ascent, so be ready for loose rocks and possible slips. 9) Leave no trace behind, and pack out all of your trash.","Easy to park, Great conditions, Great views",5.0

Hike took 4 hours and 25 minutes in total- about 2 hours 25 minutes going up and about 2 hours coming down. If you don’t hike regularly, plan for it to take a bit longer. Sign at trailhead says 6-8 hours, but 8 hours sounds impossibly slow, as that would translate to only one mile per hour, even going downhill.

Wind is biggest obstacle on this route. Don’t let prior reviews scare you: this is a National Park trail and is well-defined, well-graded, well-manicured and rates easy/moderate for fit hikers. Nothing sketchy. Beta: Winds at the summit were 55-60 mph today. Expect heavy gusts especially when turning the corner around the 1.5 mile mark (there’s a large bulbous rock outcropping) prior to entering the forest section (the route’s middle third). Heavy gusts along the final set of switchbacks on the summit push as well. Note that despite the wind’s strength, it pushes you against the mountain, not away from it. Snow/ice were mostly negligible; I brought microspikes but they were unnecessary. There was some packed mix at upper elevations that was not all that slippery; on the late morning descent, the mix in the forest section had slushified. GPS/phone signals get bounced around here. My Garmin and phone continually flip-flopped between Mountain and Central time, and my Garmin improperly recorded my elevation gain as being over 4000 feet despite accurate altitudes at the trailhead and summit. There were a few parking spots left when I pulled up at 7:45 am. Flush bathrooms and water at the trailhead as well as the visitors center. Light trail traffic on the ascent, moderate on the descent.

The first mile and a half was rough for me as you were constantly going up and taking huge steps to get over little wood plank steps, after that it became easier. There were some instances where you were really on the edge so be careful and take your time. About 3-3.5 miles in you reach a beautiful pine forest and then the last half mile you trekking upwards again to reach the peak. It was chilly up there but the visibility was amazing.

Eventually you hit the backside of the mountain and it’s shaded. I would argue that the last half mile to a mile is also very hard. Again lots of elevation gain. There are lots of rocks along the trail making slippery at times and there are areas that are narrow and right alongside the cliff. If you’re not great with heights it might be a lot for you. I would 100% recommend trekking poles. We did do it without poles so it’s possible but I wish we had them, mostly for the way down, it’s pretty steep.

545,2024-09-17,"Start this hike as early as possible for best conditions. You will be exposed to the sun for the majority of this strenuous hike. The first 1.5 miles of switchbacks is by far the hardest part, so if you make it through that and to the back side of the mountain to the shade, then you are capable of the entire hike!","Easy to park, Not crowded, Bathrooms available, Great conditions, Great views",5.0
546,2024-09-16,"It’s a fun trail with great views. The hardest part is the elevation gain, but there were some really good sitting rocks along the whole trail. I personally tested out a lot of these rocks. My watch tracked the hike as 10.3 miles out and back. When I made it to mile 4, and saw I wasn’t close to the peak,I may or may not have shed a tear. That’s between the trail and I. If you hike it in the morning, you’ll get a lot of shade on the back ofthe mountain between miles 2-3. But most of the hike is in the sun so bring lots of water. I brought 2 liters and it wasn’t enough.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Great conditions, Great views",5.0

548,2024-09-14,"Awesome hike! Hard, but totally doable and well worth it. We completed it in ~4.5h with a break for lunch at the top. We went on a Saturday morning and there were others there, but not crowded at all. The visitors center has nice bathrooms and a water bottle fill station. Definitely recommend!","Easy to park, Not crowded, Bathrooms available, Great conditions, Great views",5.0

550,2024-09-14,"This was a very hike and not for the faint of heart. There were plenty of people on the trail on a Saturday and everyone was incredibly friendly. The way up has very few flat spots or declines, it's all uphill. Take more water than you think you'll need. also bring plenty of calories to intake. It was cloudy and rainy for my day and it made for beautiful sights. I highly recommend this hike to anyone in good cardiovascular shape as it is taxing, especially if you are not used to being at elevation.","Easy to park, Bathrooms available, Great views",5.0

552,2024-09-08,"Absolutely spectacular, with ever changing views the entire trail. The trails were impeccably maintained by our great national park service men and women which makes this peak pretty accessible for the elevation gain and distance. This is definitely a tough one if you are not prepared. Coming from frequent hiking at higher elevation, it was quite pleasant and not particularly difficult. These trail difficulties are all relative. Be smart and make good decisions. We had group members with varying degrees of ability and acclimation, so it took us longer than it would have otherwise, but I couldn’t think of another place I would rather be at the time. Enjoy and be safe.","Great conditions, Great views",5.0
553,2024-09-08,"Great trail, even if you reach the peak, the views throughout the way are worth it. Remember to take your time and enjoy it, as it not always about the peak but the journey.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Bathrooms available, Great conditions, Great views",5.0
554,2024-09-04,Good advice from all other reviews - thanks. We made it to the top but unfortunately it was cloudy so zero views. On the plus side it kept the temperature down.,,5.0
555,2024-09-04,"Hiked 9.4.24. A little muddy in spots only because it had rained a couple of days prior. Overall, trail was in good shape. Agree with others- 1st 1.5 the hardest. Fog cloud rolled in, so our view was non-existent at the top, thank goodness for the monument! The trip down was hard on my hubby's knees. Trekking poles helped a lot.

557,2024-09-01,"It was a truly hard hike but I made it to the top! The elevation gain of close to 3000 feet in 4 miles is intense. Very rocky trail. It seems harder going back, but I contribute it to being tired after going up. If you have any issues with your knees, this may not be the best hike for you. I saw a limping twenty-something year old on my way down. He said his knee just started hurting. Please be careful. Rocks get slippery when it rains. Bring a gallon of water and food to eat on the way. A ranger said the hike lasts 6-8 hours. I took my time so it was closer to 9 hours. It is windy and cold on top, so plan your clothing accordingly.

559,2024-09-01,The top was very difficult psychologically for someone who is afraid of heights (me). There is one point where it looks like the path narrows to just a few inches but it is an optical illusion. It does narrow but only slightly and widens back out after 2 steps. I left my pack on the side of the trail to pass through that spot and collected it again on my way down. The wind picked up and my fear of heights increased as I worked my way back down. Could barely feel my legs by the time I reached the bottom but still loved the experience and glad to check this trail off my bucket list!,Good views,4.0
560,2024-09-01,Didn’t start the app until we were 2.6 miles in. 1st mile and the last mile before the summit were the toughest. There was a little bit of scrambling up top. Phenomenal views. We were able to head back before the weather rolled in. Trekking poles were a huge help. Great prep for the R2R In October,"Good conditions, Good views, Easy to park, Not crowded",4.0
561,2024-09-01,"Took our family of 3, including our 8 year old, just under 6 hours roundtrip, not including our lunch break. It was breezy and cloudy, but we didn't get rained on.

565,2024-08-29,"I tackled this on Thursday, Aug 29. I arrived about 0600 and only one car in the parking lot. I parked right at the trailhead. I have an extreme fear of heights and this was tough for me. I carried 4 liters of water and electrolytes and that it still was not enough. I am from San Antonio and use to the heat but the weather showed high 81, it was 86 in the sun near the peak. I got within about 200 ft from the top and stopped with cramps. A couple showed up and said I better turn around and then said ""but you are so close. "" I decided to go up and I am glad I did. Only ten climbers total on the mountain the entire day. Some scrambling at the top, other climbers remarked it's difficult to see a trail up there. It took me forever to get down but cramps finally let up. Another guy also had bad cramps and we were wondering who would need help first. Earlier in the week a family had to be airlifted out (you can find videos). Advise to check the weather and add a few degrees to the high. Bring more water than you need and extra salt. Funny quip: one couple going down when checked in with the two female park rangers reported when they asked for any advice the young woman said ""Don't die up there."" No joke. PS: One couple I talked to said this climb is harder than Mt Elbert in CO. Perception is everything.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Great views",5.0

570,2024-08-25,"Beautiful, hot, clear day. As mentioned in prior reviews, the trail is in great shape with only one or two sketchy spots. Tough going for the first two miles. Then the trail greatly reduces in grade for a bit, then the last half mile becomes very strenuous once again. 3k feet upwards later and you're at the top. Dry, hot, not a lot of shade bring more water than you'll think. PS. Saw someone with a dog, big no-no. Keep the pets at home when coming to GUMO, the rangers had to get involved.",,5.0
571,2024-08-24,Third time up to the top of Texas. Always a good time. I prefer the cooler months but needed to use this as a warmup for a R2R in October.

Not many on the trail until I summitted, where there were almost a dozen already. Wonderful views all around. Many more people on the way down. When I finished, the weather was still nice and not too hot. All in all, up and down in under 3 hrs with some time spent at the peak. Trekking poles help.","Good conditions, Good views, Easy to park, Not crowded",4.0
576,2024-08-06,"Cross country road trip pit stop. I had an awesome experience. Very peaceful. No crowds! Easily accessible and you can pull up right to the trailheads. Not as hot as I expected for August, but still very warm in the afternoon. This seems like a small national park, but very beautiful especially for Texas which isn’t known for its tall mountains. I was only able to hike about 2 miles or so up the trail. I thought it was a lovely trail and very easy to follow. Not overly strenuous in my opinion if you are acclimated to higher altitude hikes. Will come back one day to finish the peak and spend some time on the other trails.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Bathrooms available, Dog-friendly, Great conditions, Great views",5.0
577,2024-08-03,"Prepare yourself mentally to do the hike. The first 2 miles are HARD. Bring one gallon of water per person. What I did is that I froze half of gallon in my water bladder and I added more water. I started the hike around 9 am, it was really hot. I brought alot of snacks, I did took breaks going up. I do not recommend going alone. It took me 8 hrs to finished this hike. Coming back we actually got a little bit of rain and it was cloudy my whole way down. Parking is 20 bucks, they have a little store open from 8am-4pm. The view is amazing. I totally recommend this hike.","Easy to park, Not crowded, Great conditions",5.0
578,2024-08-03,"This trail is worth every step, but is challenging. There are a lot of big step ups, and the trails get very narrow. Don’t be in a rush and bring plenty of water.

581,2024-08-02,"I have been hiking the majority of my life. I did not find this to be a difficult hike. I hiked in trail runners. I took a gallon of water, lots of snacks, electrolytes and had lunch at the top. I started at 7:45am and ended at 3pm- hiking very slowly. I took 45min at the top to just take in the view. There are plenty of shady places to rest along the way. The rangers said the first 2 miles are the most challenging, but the last mile is nothing to laugh at. The last bit the trail is not as clear, so take a map! The views are gorgeous!

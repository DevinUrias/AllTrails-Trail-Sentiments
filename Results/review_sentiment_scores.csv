2025-07-23,5.0,"This is a difficult but worthwhile hike. Hiked the summit with my wife, 12 yr old, 14 yr old and 16 yr old. We are not hikers. We arrived at the visitors center at 9, hit the restrooms, grabbed some prickly pear snacks and got to hiking. Parking was plentiful, and we only saw 5 other couples on the entire trip. Insane. The start of the hike is strenuous with switchbacks and lots of stairs. Then it’s a pretty enjoyable hike until the last half mile to the summit. We were fortunate withy the weather, with temps in the high 60’s when we started and mid 70’s when we finished. Left out at 9:15 to start hiking. Returned to the car at 4:45. We stopped for lunch near the summit on the way back. Gorgeous views from nearly the time you start climbing. We’ve hiked throughout Colorado and were blown away by the beauty and challenge Guadalupe Peak had to offer. Bring more water than you anticipate, it’s extremely windy at the summit, and make sure you have good footwear. Lots of rocky, gravel, granite, and in general rough terrain. 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommend, and with enough rest, would do it again.","hiked the summit with my wife, 12 yr old, 14 yr old and 16 yr old. the start of the hike is strenuous with switchbacks and lots of stairs. then it’s a pretty enjoyable hike until the last half mile to the summit. we were fortunate withy the weather, with temps in the high 60’s when we started and mid 70’s when we finished. left out at 9:15 to start hiking. we stopped for lunch near the summit on the way back. gorgeous views from nearly the time you start climbing. we’ve hiked throughout colorado and were blown away by the beauty and challenge guadalupe peak had to offer. bring more water than you anticipate, it’s extremely windy at the summit, and make sure you have good footwear. 5 out of 5 stars.",the start of the hike is strenuous with switchbacks and lots of stairs.,,"this is a difficult but worthwhile hike. highly_recommend, and with enough rest, would do it again.",0.98628,0.0,,0.73164,0.99132

Smooth sailing up to the campground. The last mile becomes moderate again to the top. Previous reports of ""rock exposure"" were vastly overstated. Very limited exposed sections that I wouldn't even consider a scramble. Battling a nasty head cold, still managed a moving time under 5hrs up and down. Summit was socked in, sadly no views.

2025-05-22,5.0,"Parked in the lot at about 4:35 am NM time, wore a headlamp up. First couple miles are pretty brutally uphill, but no issues keeping trail or seeing where to go. It's definitely best this time of year to make it out as early as you can to avoid the heat, as there is very limited shade until you get a couple miles in. It's uphill 95% of the way (shocker) which is why it's nice to do in the morning while it's cooler. You will be rewarded with a beautiful sunrise and much more pleasant temperatures. My GPS messed up with AllTrails, but it took me 4:51 of moving time to make it up and down. My Garmin said it was 8.35 miles round trip. I did stop and hang out for a little bit at the top to have a snack. I drank about 48 oz of water on the way up, being in the dark and early morning sun is much easier on the body. I was carrying an additional half gallon of water just in case though. I saw lots of people with hiking poles if that is your style, I went without. You will need sun protection if you go up later than I started, and bring more water than you think. I can't even imagine trying to do this hike in the heat and broad daylight. It was taxing enough on the body just coming down at 9-10 am. There are a couple pretty steep parts towards the top where you will need to boulder. The loose rock others have mentioned isn't unbearable and I didn't feel like I was losing my footing anywhere. There are lots of rock and wood steps so you can maintain a good pace. Great hike, so glad I made time to do this. Absolutely stunning views from the top and all the way up.

I trained on the treadmill, with resistance bands, I took diamox. I was worried about whether I could make it up. I did it! I was very proud of myself. The way down was treacherous- for me. I don't do well on loose rocks. I had one pretty bad fall - my first aid kit came in handy- no broken bones. By the time I was half way down I was so exhausted that I felt drunk. (Yes, we had plenty of water and snacks.) We started at sunrise- it took us a full 9 hours round trip. When we got back to the AirBnb, everything hurt. So, I'm proud that I did it, but I think I'm done with ""strenuous"" hikes at altitude.","(yes, we had plenty of water and snacks.) we started at sunrise- it took us a full 9 hours round trip.","so, i'm proud that i did it, but i think i'm done with ""strenuous"" hikes at altitude.",,i had one pretty bad fall - my first aid kit came in handy- no broken bones.,-0.43923999999999996,0.10468,,-0.4768,-0.65084

It was an unforgettable adventure, but also incredibly challenging, even for our family, who is used to hiking regularly. Our kids, ages 8 and 10, are experienced hikers and accustomed to high-altitude conditions since we live in an elevated area. Despite their preparation and stamina, this trail proved to be tough after so many hours—our pace was 1.1 miles per hour. The trail is rocky, steep, and involves climbing an entire mountain, making it more suitable for adults or older teens. The views along the way are absolutely breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment at the summit is unmatched. However, the high winds made the descent tricky, and the long duration pushed our kids’ endurance to its limits. Even though we were well-prepared with water, snacks, and gear, the sheer length of the hike—combined with the rugged terrain—made it physically exhausting, especially for younger hikers. While we love hiking as a family and would tackle this kind of challenge again in the future, we’d recommend this trail only for those prepared for a long, demanding climb. Families with younger kids might want to consider a shorter or less strenuous hike.

For example, you can hike the steep first 3 miles until the saddle, a really nice rock formation that indicates the start of the “forest” trail. The forest is just awesome! So many trees and beautiful view. From the forest you can hike to the bridge. Nice bridge, take photos there! After the bridge path is narrower and hugs the mountain side, the view is incredibly beautiful! It is already very high from there. After the bridge you are very close to the top, maybe 30-40min depending on your pace. There is only one section of the ridge that needs more attention to the footing, but it is so short, two steps and you are out of it. It is located in the very end, a weird curve to the trail. The top is windy and cold and magnificent! Please do go to the highest point in Texas! I really enjoyed the hike! Pro tips: - allow yourself 8h to do the trail even tho you might finish early. So calculate the finishing time to be before sunset. Staring at 9-10am is a good start time. We started at 10am and finished at 2:30pm. We had time to enjoy the top and take some photos in the way down . - wear good grip shoes. There trail is mostly rocks and sand. You need good shoes.

My biggest concern heading into the day was whether there would be snow or ice, but fortunately, as of today, there was absolutely none.

Trail conditions were exactly like all the other popular trails I've done out West - maintained, easy to follow, and filled with an unbelievable amount of switchbacks. While the ascent was rocky and continuous, those switchbacks made it easy to make good time. Even though it wasn't windy today, a windbreaker would probably be a good idea for Guadalupe Peak's reputation. I'd also recommend hiking poles for an easier descent. There is a $10 parking fee, which is paid at the information/welcome center. As expected for a Saturday, there were some crowds, but they were all pretty spread out. In terms of exposure, there were only two somewhat sketchy no-fall zones, but I never felt scared at any point today.

2024-11-29,5.0,"Memories of the desert! The Guadalupe Peak Trail in Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of Texas. It is an out and back trail type with 2949 ft elevation gain. The summit provides breathtaking views of the El Capitan and Chihuahuan desert landscape. The trail features steep sections, switchbacks, rough terrain, and narrow paths with drop-offs, especially near the summit where we had to do some scrambling. The trail run through pinyon pine and Douglas-fir forests and is well maintained. We observed various cacti (including prickly pear cactus, cane cholla), sotol, lime pine, and others, in addition to shrubs. We did this trekking on 29th November 2024 to experience the stunning desert environment. It was a bright morning and the weather was excellent. Our first mistake was beginning the trek a little later than planned. This was our first strenuous trekking and it took 9.5 hours to finish which includes multiple pauses, snacking, and photography. Because the time zone was frequently changing, occasionally we found it challenging to keep track of the time. We had to trek in the dark using flashlight for the last 1 hour, for which we were not prepared, but here the fellow hikers are really nice, one couple helped us showing light. The second mistake we did was parked our vehicle near the visitor centre parking area. After this level of hiking, it was very difficult to walk extra few miles in dark to get to our car. A visitor provided us with a lift to the parking lot. We gained a lot of knowledge from this hike. Although we faced a few challenges but still it was a very memorable trek for us. On the basis of our experience following are the suggestions: 1) Begin your trek early in the morning. 2) Before heading out, please check the weather forecast and check the trail conditions from the park’s website. 3) Park your vehicle close to the trail’s parking space. 4) Put on sturdy hiking shoes with good traction. Please make sure you have all your hiking gear (Hiking poles, headlamp, medical kits etc.) with you. 5) Be prepared for shifting weather conditions, and wear layers that you can adjust as needed. 6) Carry snacks and enough water for the entire trek. 7) Don't overextend yourself, and take breaks when necessary. 8) The descent can be more difficult than the ascent, so be ready for loose rocks and possible slips. 9) Leave no trace behind, and pack out all of your trash.","the guadalupe peak trail in guadalupe mountains national park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of texas. the summit provides breathtaking views of the el capitan and chihuahuan desert landscape. the trail features steep sections, switchbacks, rough terrain, and narrow paths with drop-offs, especially near the summit where we had to do some scrambling. we did this trekking on 29th november 2024 to experience the stunning desert environment. this was our first strenuous trekking and it took 9.5 hours to finish which includes multiple pauses, snacking, and photography.","the guadalupe peak trail in guadalupe mountains national park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of texas. the trail features steep sections, switchbacks, rough terrain, and narrow paths with drop-offs, especially near the summit where we had to do some scrambling. this was our first strenuous trekking and it took 9.5 hours to finish which includes multiple pauses, snacking, and photography. because the time zone was frequently changing, occasionally we found it challenging to keep track of the time.",,the guadalupe peak trail in guadalupe mountains national park is a strenuous (based on our strength level) yet worthwhile 8.4 miles round trip that leads to the highest peak of texas. it was a bright morning and the weather was excellent. although we faced a few challenges but still it was a very memorable trek for us.,0.95228,0.89404,,0.89564,0.9894000000000001

Wind is biggest obstacle on this route. Don’t let prior reviews scare you: this is a National Park trail and is well-defined, well-graded, well-manicured and rates easy/moderate for fit hikers. Nothing sketchy. Beta: Winds at the summit were 55-60 mph today. Expect heavy gusts especially when turning the corner around the 1.5 mile mark (there’s a large bulbous rock outcropping) prior to entering the forest section (the route’s middle third). Heavy gusts along the final set of switchbacks on the summit push as well. Note that despite the wind’s strength, it pushes you against the mountain, not away from it. Snow/ice were mostly negligible; I brought microspikes but they were unnecessary. There was some packed mix at upper elevations that was not all that slippery; on the late morning descent, the mix in the forest section had slushified. GPS/phone signals get bounced around here. My Garmin and phone continually flip-flopped between Mountain and Central time, and my Garmin improperly recorded my elevation gain as being over 4000 feet despite accurate altitudes at the trailhead and summit.

I have an extreme fear of heights and this was tough for me. I carried 4 liters of water and electrolytes and that it still was not enough. I am from San Antonio and use to the heat but the weather showed high 81, it was 86 in the sun near the peak. I got within about 200 ft from the top and stopped with cramps. A couple showed up and said I better turn around and then said ""but you are so close. "" I decided to go up and I am glad I did. Only ten climbers total on the mountain the entire day. Some scrambling at the top, other climbers remarked it's difficult to see a trail up there. It took me forever to get down but cramps finally let up. Another guy also had bad cramps and we were wondering who would need help first. Earlier in the week a family had to be airlifted out (you can find videos). Advise to check the weather and add a few degrees to the high. Bring more water than you need and extra salt. Funny quip: one couple going down when checked in with the two female park rangers reported when they asked for any advice the young woman said ""Don't die up there."" No joke.
